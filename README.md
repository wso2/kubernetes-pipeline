# Helm Resources for WSO2 Kubernetes Pipeline

WSO2 Kubernetes Pipeline provides tools and a preconfigured pipeline used for continuous integration and deployment.
The setup is deployed on top of Kubernetes using Helm, which makes the processes of configuring, installing, scaling and upgrading, quite simple.

Following are the tools used to install and monitor the pipeline

- Jenkins: For continuous integration
- Spinnaker: For continuous deployment to Kubernetes
- ELK: For centralized logging
- Prometheus Operator: For monitoring deployments and visualization using Grafana
